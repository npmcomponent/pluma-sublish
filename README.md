```

# API

## new PubSub()

Creates a new PubSub instance.

**NOTE:** This is a constructor. Use of the `new` keyword is therefore not optional.

## PubSub(obj)

Applies `PubSub` to the given obj as a mixin.

## PubSub#subscribe(callback:Function)

Adds the given callback function to this object's list of subscribers.

**NOTE:** The callback will be called with the PubSub instance as its context. If you want to preserve the callback's original context, use `Function#bind` or (in legacy browsers) wrap the callback in a closure.

## PubSub#unsubscribe(callback:Function)

Removes the given callback function from this object's list of subscribers.

## PubSub#publish(argsâ€¦)

Publishes the given arguments as a message. Every callback function in this object's list of subscribers will be called sequentially with the given messages as its arguments.
